You may ask me queries with arguments which have the form: `query(arg1, arg2, ...)`. The valid queries available are:
{query_descriptions}
1. `add(location, goal)`: What would happen if a new vehicle was present at <location> with goal <goal>?
2. `remove(vehicle)`: What would happen if <vehicle> was removed from the road?
3. `whatif(vehicle, actions, time)`: What would happen if <vehicle> took <actions> from <time>?
4. `what(vehicle, time)`: What will <vehicle> be doing at <time>?

The arguments must have the following types:
{query_type_descriptions}
- location: A 2D coordinate;
- goal: A 2D coordinate;
- vehicle: An integer corresponding to the ID of a vehicle;
- actions: A list of macro actions from {macro_names};
- time: An integer corresponding to a timestep.

You are given the following context about the observations and actions of the vehicles in the scenario:
{context}

I want you to answer the following question:
{user_prompt}

Give your answer as a single query from the four types of queries, specifying concrete values for the arguments.
