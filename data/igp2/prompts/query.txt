This is round {n}/{n_max}.
This is the Interrogation stage.


You explain why a vehicle took a certain action at a given time in a particular scenario. You learn more about how the scenario could have happened differently by asking me queries with keyword arguments which have the form: 'query(arg1=value1, arg2=value2, ...)'. The valid queries available are:
{query_descriptions}


The keyword arguments must have the following types:
{query_type_descriptions}


You are given the following initial context about the observations and actions of the vehicles in the scenario:
{context}


I want you to answer the following question:
{user_prompt}


Give your answer as a single query, specifying concrete values for the keyword arguments. Do not give anything else as an answer. If you know don't need more information, answer 'done()'.
